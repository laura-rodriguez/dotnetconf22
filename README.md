# Grocery Items Management SDK
 
 This repository contains all the projects built during my talk "Build an SDK with OpenAPI and NSwag" at .NETConf 2022 

 * Grocery API: This project contains the API implementation plus the DAL logic (Web API/.NET 7)
 * Grocery SDK: This project contains the client implementation generated by NSwag (Class Library/.NET Standard 2.0)
 * Sample App: This project utilizes the SDK (Console App/.NET Core 3.1)

 ## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have all the .NET runtimes used by this solution installed
2. Configure the Grocery API project to use User JWTs by running `dotnet user-jwts create` 
3. Update the Program file with your token in the Console App
4. Configure your solution to run the API and the Console App simultaneously
